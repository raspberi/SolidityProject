# SolidityProject
This Solidity program is a demonstration of lessons showcased in the Solidity - Beginner module of Metacrafters. The purpose of this program is to apply the said lessons while simulating the creation of one's own token.

## Description
This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three public variables and two functions. The variables store the information on the created token, while the functions are for the minting and burning of said token. The program immerses the learner into the processes common in the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Download the raw file of the myToken.sol file that is in this repository. Head over to the Remix website and upload myToken.sol in your workspace.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "myToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by pasting an address from the provided sample addresses into the mint and burn functions and then specifying values. You can observe how each transaction affect the balances as well as the total supply.
